# JFTT Code Golf Compiler 
This is my compiler for JFTT course.

I wasn't focusing much on optimization as I wanted to take part in code golf challenge but my compiler got 4.0 anyway

Usage:
python3 main.py [ input file ] [ output file ]

If you have any questions about my compiler or need help, feel free to contact me

PS I know this compiler is badly formatted but it doesn't matter while you write codegolf code
